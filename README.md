Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950)



In the paper, Turing famously concludes that the question of whether machines can think is too ambiguous to answer definitively. Instead, he suggests that the more meaningful question is whether machines can imitate human behavior to the point where they are indistinguishable from humans in certain contexts. This pragmatic approach laid the foundation for much of modern AI research.

The paper remains a classic work in both AI and philosophy, and the Turing Test is still used as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence, though more recent developments in AI have led to new methods of assessment.
